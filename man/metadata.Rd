\subsection{\code{metadata} A list with the following data frames:}{
\itemize{
\item \code{events}: Contains the columns \code{event_number}, \code{event_name}, and
\code{event_label}. Used to create a simple timeline in the application, with
predefined number of planned visits.
\item \code{common_forms}: Contains the columns \code{var}, \code{suffix}, \code{item_name} ,
\code{item_type}, \code{item_group}. Used to select and rename the variables of
interest in the common forms.
\item \code{study_forms}: Contains the same columns as the data frame \code{common_forms},
and in addition the columns \code{unit}, \code{lower_limit}, \code{uppter_limit}. Used to
select and rename the variables of interest in the common forms.
\item \code{general}: Contains the same columns as \code{common_forms}.
\item \code{form_level_data}: For specifying form-level data. When reading in metadata
from the Excel format, this table will created and sanitized if needed,
creating the minimum columns  \code{item_group}, \code{item_scale},
\code{use_unscaled_limits}, and \code{review_required}. The column \code{item_group}
contains the name of the forms to which the settings apply. Columns
\code{item_scale} and \code{use_unscaled_limits} are used in
\code{\link[=mod_study_forms_server]{mod_study_forms_server()}} to specify the scaling of the figures. It is
recommended to set the required values here; by default, they are both set
to FALSE in \code{\link[=mod_study_forms_server]{mod_study_forms_server()}}. The last column that is expected
here is \code{review_required}, which can be used to specify whether review is
required for a form. Will default to TRUE for each form it is unset for a
form.
\item \code{settings} contains custom \code{ClinSight} settings. Currently these are available:
}
\enumerate{
\item Settings for adjusting and customizing study data when merging with
metadata using \code{\link[=merge_meta_with_data]{merge_meta_with_data()}}. If a custom function name is added
here, the function will run at the described moment of the merging process
(before or after merging or data pivoting):
\itemize{
\item \code{pre_merge_fns}
\item \code{pre_pivot_fns}
\item \code{post_pivot_fns}
\item \code{post_merge_fns}
}
\item Other (misc.) settings:
\itemize{
\item \code{treatment_label} to set the label for the treatments in the interactive timeline. Defaults to "ðŸ’Š Tâ‚“".
}
}

Can be created with an Excel file. The Excel file format is chosen so
that the metadata can be changed easily per study. See
\code{raw-data/metadata.R} for details.

\description{
A list of data frames containing metadata that will be used for the
application. The metadata will be merged with with raw data. It controls the
variables that will be used in the application, and in which tab the
variables will be shown. The goal is that most, if not all, study-specific
data will be captured in the metadata, leaving the scripts to run the
application largely unaltered between studies.
