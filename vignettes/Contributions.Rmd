Thank you for your interest in contributing to this repository! Your contribution is highly valued. Please go through this document for guidance on how to contribute.

## Style guide

In general, we follow the tidyverse style guide. 

## Starting a Pull Request (PR).

* When starting on a new task/issue:
	* base your branch off `dev` to start. The `master` branch should in general only be used for new package releases and hotfixes.
	* Name the branch with the GitHub issue id (or multiple ids if applicable) and a short description of the issue, in the following form: <issue_id1_issue_id2>-<short_description>. 
  * Please create a branch in the repository instead of forking the repository, unless you are not (yet) a team member. 

## PR Checklist

* The version number is incremented appropriately (using `usethis::use_version("dev")` and `golem::set_golem_version()`).
* Unit tests were added that test new functions/functionality, and test whether a bug was resolved.
  * Use [BDD style](https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/) descriptions to test (new) application modules and for integration tests.
* (if applicable) The NEWS.md file is updated with the PR solution, linking to the GitHub issue when possible.
* A screenshot is added if it can provide added value. It helps everyoneâ€™s comprehension of the problem and shows what you are observing first hand.
* (if applicable) test data is updated.
* All documentation is updated (run `run_dev.R` or `devtools::document()`)
* The PR is based on the correct branch (usually the `dev` branch).
* The PR description field is filled or refers to a GitHub issue. 
* All GitHub Actions workflows are passing.
* There are no merge conflicts.
* Only if all above are complete: the appropriate reviewer was assigned.

## PR Merging

* For a PR to be eligible for merge, you must have:
    * At least 1 review approval
    * All conversations resolved
    * All GitHub actions workflows passing

## Authorship

* On your second PR that will close out an open issue, add your info to the `DESCRIPTION` file with the role [ctb] which stands for "contributor". You can update your role to [aut] which stands for "author" when you've completed at least two of the following achievements:
  * Closed 6 open issues with PR's
  * its been at least 6 months since your first commit & faithfully attend bi-weekly dev meetups
  * have committed 1,000 lines of code
