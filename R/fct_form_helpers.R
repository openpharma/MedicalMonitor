#' Update Review Records
#'
#' Updates the review records data frame when a datatable checkbox is clicked.
#'
#' @param review_records The review records data frame to update.
#' @param review_selection The review selection data frame input from the
#'   datatable.
#' @param active_data The active review data frame.
#'
#' @details Three main steps are performed: UPSERT, SUBSET, and ANTI-JOIN The
#'   UPSERT takes the review selection data frame and upserts it into the review
#'   records data frame. (An upsert will insert a record if the unique
#'   identifier is not yet present and update a record based on the unique
#'   identifier if it already exists.) The SUBSET step removes an empty reviews
#'   (partially review rows) and any records not part of the active review (as a
#'   precautionary measure). The ANTI-JOIN step removes any records that match
#'   the active review (records that will not be changing review status based on
#'   user inputs).

#' Overall Reviewed Field
#'
#' This field serves as the main communication mechanism between the Shiny
#' session and the DataTable objects in the browser.
#'
#' @format A list with up to five elements:
#' \describe{
#'    \item{reviewed}{A logical indicating the current review status of the table row.}
#'    \item{ids}{A vectors containing the `id`s associated with the table row.}
#'    \item{row_id}{A numeric value indicating the associated row in the DataTable. (Used to update server data set based on user changes to browser table.)}
#'    \item{disabled}{A logical indicating whether the table row is part of the active review.}
#'    \item{updated}{A logical indicating whether the user has changed the review status in the DataTable.}
#' }
#'
#' @details The first three elements, `reviewed`, `ids`, and `row_id`, are
#'   initialized when the datatable data set is created (via `create_table()`
#'   etc.). This occurs whenever there is a change with the review data. The
#'   `disabled` element gets updated whenever there is a change in which subject
#'   is actively being reviewed. The `updated` field gets changed in one of
#'   three events: the subject being reviewed is changed and `updated` gets set
#'   to `NULL`, a user changed review status in the DataTable object and
#'   `updated` gets set to the user inputted value, and finally when a user
#'   changes the overall review status in the sidebar and `updated` gets set to
#'   reflect that inputted value.
